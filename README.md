# Prompt Optimization Assistant

## Latest Changes

- Added a comprehensive `userguide.md` detailing usage and optimization criteria.
- Enhanced prompt optimization approach to:
  - Maintain original intent while improving clarity and specificity.
  - Incorporate actionable instructions, context, and output format.
  - Address edge cases and eliminate ambiguity.
  - Provide examples and constraints for optimal AI performance.

## Approach
