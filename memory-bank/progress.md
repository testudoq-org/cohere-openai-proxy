# Project Progress Summary

**Project:** Cohere Proxy Server Enhancement  
**Status:** Production-ready

## Overview

The Cohere Proxy Server is now a robust, stateless, and scalable service with modern JavaScript best practices, comprehensive error handling, and advanced token management. All recent fixes and improvements have been applied and verified.

## Key Improvements

- Modular, class-based architecture with focused methods
- Async initialization: model fetching moved out of constructor and into `start`
- API compatibility: uses `models.list()` and correct Cohere API methods
- Comprehensive error handling: specific status codes, error types, and processing time in responses
- Security: rate limiting, Helmet headers, CORS, API key validation
- Multi-model support and OpenAI API compatibility
- Token usage estimation, overflow handling, and request tracking
- In-memory caching for prompt responses
- Fallback to default models if Cohere API is unavailable
- Modern JavaScript: deprecated methods replaced, clean destructuring, and best practices throughout
- Clear, actionable documentation and configuration guides

## Technical Summary

- **Architecture:** Stateless, horizontally scalable, Docker-ready
- **Async Patterns:** No async logic in constructor; all async initialization in `start`
- **Security:** All configuration via environment variables; no sensitive data in logs
- **Monitoring:** Health endpoint, structured logging, performance metrics
- **Testing:** Unit/integration tests, modular design
- **Deployment:** Graceful shutdown, health checks, Docker support

## Configuration

Environment variables:
- `COHERE_API_KEY` (required)
- `PORT` (default: 3000)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (default: *)
- `MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS`, `MIN_COMPLETION_TOKENS`, `MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS`, `TOKEN_SAFETY_BUFFER`
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`, `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`

## Readiness Checklist

- Security, monitoring, error handling, and documentation complete
- Stateless and scalable for production deployment
- All features tested and documented
- All recent code fixes and improvements verified and documented
