# Project Progress Summary

**Project:** Cohere Proxy Server Enhancement  
**Status:** In progress (ESM refactor + RAG improvements merged)

## Snapshot

Recent merge delivered the following verified changes:

- ESM refactor: `src/` layout and `package.json` updated to `"type": "module"`.
- Background indexing: RAG indexing now enqueues jobs and processes them asynchronously.
- Embedding cache: LRU+TTL cache in `src/utils/lruTtlCache.mjs` to reduce embedding API calls.
- Semantic retrieval + fallback: embedding-first search with keyword fallback.
- Conversation manager: session LRU pruning and graceful shutdown hooks.
- Structured logging & metrics: `pino` + basic `prom-client` counters added.
- Tests: Vitest unit tests and Supertest-based endpoint tests added and validated locally.
- Docker/build: `build-dist.mjs`, updated Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` to run ESM entrypoint.

## Done / Validated

- Convert repo to ESM: Done
- Non-blocking indexing (background queue): Done
- Embedding caching (LRU+TTL): Done
- RAG semantic fallback: Done
- Basic observability (pino, prom-client): Done
- Unit & endpoint tests (Vitest + Supertest): Done (core flows)

## Pending / Next PRs

- Full request schema validation (Zod/AJV) and strict API contracts
- API auth (API-key middleware) for admin/RAG endpoints
- Circuit-breaker + robust retry wrapper for Cohere API calls
- Persistent vector DB adapter + Redis for distributed caching
- SSE/streaming chat support and large-response streaming
- Expand tests and CI (coverage reporting)

## How to validate locally (PowerShell)

Below are copy/paste-ready PowerShell commands you can run from the repository root (`D:\Code\Temp\cohere-openai-proxy`) to validate common checks. Expected outputs are noted where helpful.

1) Install dependencies (first run / after package changes):

```powershell
npm install
```

Expected: completes without errors and writes to `node_modules/`.

2) Run unit + endpoint tests (Vitest):

```powershell
npm test --silent
```

Expected: all tests pass; example snippet from a successful run shows `passed` counts and no failing tests.

3) Start dev server (in the foreground) and verify `/health`:

```powershell
npm run start:dev
# in a separate shell:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:3000/health
```

Expected: JSON health payload with basic fields like `uptime`, `version`, and `ragIndexSize` (or similar). If port 3000 is in use, the server logs the selected port.

4) Enqueue a quick RAG index job (local test)

```powershell
# replace <ADMIN_KEY> with your API key if API auth is enabled
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:3000/v1/rag/index -Body (@{path='.'} | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json'
```

Expected: 200/202 and JSON acknowledging the job (e.g., `{ jobId, status: 'queued' }`). Check server logs for background processing messages.

5) Run a quick chat request against the local server (OpenAI-compatible shape)

```powershell
$body = @{
  model = 'command-r'
  messages = @(@{role='user'; content='Hello, please summarize a small repo.'})
} | ConvertTo-Json
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri http://localhost:3000/v1/chat/completions -Body $body -ContentType 'application/json'
```

Expected: JSON response shaped like an OpenAI chat completion. If RAG is enabled and index populated, reply may include RAG-sourced context.

6) Run the specific test file only (fast feedback):

```powershell
npx vitest run test/endpoints.test.mjs --reporter verbose
```

Expected: That single test file runs; useful while developing endpoints or middleware.

## Notes

- If you add new dependencies (for follow-up PRs), run `npm install` before running tests.
- For Docker-based testing, build the image using `docker build -t cohere-proxy .` and run with `docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env cohere-proxy`.
- If a test fails, run with `npx vitest --run` to get detailed failure traces.

## Notes

- The current PR focused on keeping the change small and reviewable: ESM, embedding cache, and background indexing were grouped together.
- Follow-up PRs will be scoped to single concerns and include tests for the new behavior.
